# Sudoku Solver using Python
## Python code which uses recursion and backtracking to solve any sudoku entered by the user

This project is my submission for the practical exam under the subject of _Software Craftsmanship Lab_ during the first semester of my _B. Tech CSE (Full Stack Development)_ degree. This project can be used in real-world scenarios through the following ways:

- To verify one’s sudoku solution
- To understand the backtracking algorithm
- To instantly solve any sudoku
- To check wether a sudoku is solvable or not

# Get started
Download the sudoku.py file and run it, to see the output for a pre-entered sudoku.

# How to solve my own sudoku
1. Simply uncomment the code in lines 65-68
2. Run the program sudoku.py
3. The program will ask to input your sudoku row by row
4. Enter each row in the form of a list with 9 elements (the numbers present in the row) then press enter
   e.g.
   for first row enter this:
   `[0, 6, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 8]`
   for second row enter this:
   `[5, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   and so on for 9 rows.
6. Just in a few seconds or less your sudoku’s solution will be displayed on the screen!
