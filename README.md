# Sudoku Solver using Python

## Python code which uses recursion and backtracking to solve any sudoku entered by the user

This project is my submission for the practical exam under the subject of _Software Craftsmanship Lab_ during the first semester of my _B. Tech CSE (Full Stack Development)_ degree. This project can be used in real-world scenarios through the following ways:

- To verify oneâ€™s sudoku solution
- To understand the backtracking algorithm
- To instantly solve any sudoku
- To check wether a sudoku is solvable or not

## Run Locally

[Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ChinmayBarik214/Sudoku-solver
```

Go to its project directory

```bash
  cd Sudoku-solver
```

Ensure [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed and run sudoku.py

```bash
  python sudoku.py
```
## Usage/Examples

1. To solve the default sudoku press 1 followed by enter
2. To solve a user-entered sudoku press 2 followed by enter
3. To exit the application press 3 followed by enter
