# Sudoku Solver using Python

## Python code which uses recursion and backtracking to solve any sudoku entered by the user

This project is my submission for the practical exam under the subject of _Software Craftsmanship Lab_ during the first semester of my _B. Tech CSE (Full Stack Development)_ degree. This project can be used in real-world scenarios through the following ways:

- To verify oneâ€™s sudoku solution
- To understand the backtracking algorithm
- To instantly solve any sudoku
- To check wether a sudoku is solvable or not

## Run Locally

[Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ChinmayBarik214/Sudoku-solver
```

Go to its project directory

```bash
  cd Sudoku-solver
```

Ensure [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed and run sudoku.py

```bash
  python sudoku.py
```

## Usage

1. To solve the default sudoku press 1 followed by enter
2. To solve a user-entered sudoku press 2 followed by enter
   - You will then be prompted to enter the sudoku row-by-row
   - Enter each row in [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format, i.e., enter the first value followed by a comma then the second value followed by a comma and so on
   - Example input for 1st row: `0, 6, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 8`
   - After you have finished typing a row press enter to start typing the next row and so on until all nine rows have been entered
   - Now your sudoku will be solved in under five seconds and its solution will be displayed!
   - In case you have entered an unsolvable sudoku the following message will be displayed `The Sudoku entered is unsolvable!`
3. To exit the application press 3 followed by enter

## Algorithm

To solve even the most challenging of these puzzles, our Sudoku solver only needs to follow three strategies:

1. If a square has only one candidate, place that value there.
2. If a candidate is unique within a row, box or column, place that value there (hidden singles).
3. If neither 1 or 2 is true in the entire grid, make a guess. Backtrack if the Sudoku becomes unsolvable.

<!-- The code also implements a check to determine if the Sudoku is solvable. This is run at the start of each solving task. --> <!-- Maybe add this? -->

<!-- Enter stuff here -->
