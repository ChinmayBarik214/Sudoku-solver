# Sudoku Solver using Python

## Python code which uses recursion and backtracking to solve any sudoku entered by the user

This project is my submission for the practical exam under the subject of _Software Craftsmanship Lab_ during the first semester of my _B. Tech CSE (Full Stack Development)_ degree. This project can be used in real-world scenarios through the following ways:

- To verify oneâ€™s sudoku solution
- To understand the backtracking algorithm
- To instantly solve any sudoku
- To check wether a sudoku is solvable or not

## Run Locally
